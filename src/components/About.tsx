              I'm a freelance data scientist and ML engineer with a degree in AI & Data from DTU, 6+ years of hands-on experience in the field of AI, and a track record of delivering real-world AI impact across industries.

            <p className="text-brand-light/70 mb-6">
              I've worked as an AI consultant, led technical projects in fast-moving teams, facilitated workshops, and advised decision-makers. I'm a certified Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer, the founder of Women in AI Denmark, and have been nominated for multiple tech awards.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-brand-light/70 mb-8">
              What sets me apart is my ability to move fluidly between strategy and execution â€” from shaping AI ideas to building full-stack solutions ready for production. Whether I'm working with international teams or speaking to 650+ people, I focus on cutting through complexity and helping businesses make AI work.
